# 🚀 Push BookIt to GitHub - Instructions

Your local git repository is **ready**! ✅

Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New"** (top left)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Repository name:** `BookIt` (or `bookit-saas`)
   - **Description:** `Resource booking SaaS - React frontend with Zustand state management`
   - **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one!)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Get Your Repository URL

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. You'll see a URL like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BookIt.git
```

## Step 3: Connect and Push (Choose One Method)

### **Method A: HTTPS (Easier, recommended)**

```bash
cd C:\Users\a2lec\OneDrive\Bureau\Projets_persos\Saas

# Add the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BookIt.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### **Method B: SSH (More secure, requires setup)**

```bash
# Add the remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/BookIt.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
